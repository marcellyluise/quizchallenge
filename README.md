A quiz playing words 

# MVP Version 1.0
In attempt to follow the requirements and best practices I believe I may have achieved it. But in software development there's always room for improvements. 

# Future improvements 
- Use Combine API to reduce complexicity of events handling 
- Maybe we should user SwiftUI to build more flexibible UIs
- Controller stills has lots of code and should be refactored so it can be easy to maintain and to scale
- Keyboard handling: should be invested more time so it can be ready to newer devices, right now it only suports iPhone 11 models and older ones
- Landscape mode it's not good to type because when keyboard is shown there's no enought space on screen to see what's going on 
- Should move user facing text to .strings file, e. g.: we should implemente Internationalization
- We should create a Networing layer and a Networking Manager to enable support to new endpoints or other URLs
- Of course we should write some tests as well
- And last but not leat, we should automate some tasks like build, running tests and deploy by implementing good practives of DevOps with Continuos Integration and Continuous Delivery
